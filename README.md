# Line Sensor Robot
This project intends to use Arduino compatible hardware to track a line across the ground using sensors and motors.

## Hardware Requirements
These parts identified below are just so I remember what was used later.

- Adafruit Feather M4 Express (SAMD51)
- Segger JLink

## Development Requirements
- Visual Studio Code (including all suggested extensions)
- KiCad 8 - Used for the schematics
- Segger JLink - Optional. Used for debugging only.
